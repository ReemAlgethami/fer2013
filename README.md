This project is about facial expression recognition using the FER2013 dataset. Images are organized by emotion, and a Python script converts them into pixel data with labels.
The processed data is then used to train a deep learning model to classify seven facial expressions, which can be applied in areas like sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and social robotics.
