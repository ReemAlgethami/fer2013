# FER2013 â€” Facial Expression Recognition

This project focuses on **facial expression recognition** using the **FER2013 dataset**.  
The dataset contains images of faces organized by emotion, separated into training and testing sets.  
A Python script was created to **convert the images into pixel values** and assign a label to each image based on its emotion.  
These processed data are then used to **train a deep learning model** capable of classifying seven different facial expressions.  
The trained model can be applied in areas such as **sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and social robotics**, helping machines understand human emotions more effectively.
